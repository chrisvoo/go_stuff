/*
The DispatchOrders function creates a random number of DispatchNotification values and sends
them through the channel that is received through the channel parameter.
There is no way to know in advance how many DispatchNotification values the DispatchOrders function will create.
To avoid to cause deadlock with all the goroutines blocker, the sender indicates when no further values are coming
through the channel, which is done by closing the channel.
The location of the arrow specifies the direction of the channel. When the arrow follows the chan keyword,
then the channel can be used only to send. The channel can be used to receive only if the arrow precedes the chan
keyword (<-chan, for example). Go allows bidirectional channels to be assigned to unidirectional channel variables,
allowing restrictions to be applied
