# PRO GO

* Create the project: `go mod init partyinvites`
* Run the project: `go run .`

This command creates a file named `go.mod`, which is used to keep track of the packages a project depends on and can also be used to publish the project, if required.
Features are grouped into packages. Dependencies on packages are made using an `import` statement, which allows the features they use to be accessed in a code file. Statements are grouped in functions, which are defined with the `func` keyword.
